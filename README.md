# Cellular Automata
 
 
 Various examples of Cellular Automata using the framework I have been developing (https://github.com/hallamrear/hLibrary/).
 
 Examples include:
 - Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
 - Langton's Ant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant)
